<p>The Prependers are a quirky four-piece from Orlando, FL.
    Critics have hailed them as the greatest post-garage-rock
    band of the last decade.</p>

    <p>They are currently writing a full length album that's a
    follow-up to their breakout 2011 album, Top Right Bottom Left,
    and their critically acclaimed EP, Opacity Zero.</p>
